## Dataset Overview

**Competition**: CAFA 6 - Protein Function Prediction
**Task**: Multi-label classification - predict GO terms from protein sequences

### Key Statistics

```
Training Set:

- Sequence lengths: 3 to 35,213 amino acids (median: 376 AA)

GO Term Distribution by Aspect:
- C (Cellular Component):    2,651 terms (10.1%)

```

## Critical Challenges

### 1. Extreme Class Imbalance

```
Label Frequency Distribution:
- Ultra-rare (1-5 proteins):      29.4% of labels  ← Major challenge!
- Rare (6-10 proteins):           22.2% of labels
- Uncommon (11-50 proteins):      28.1% of labels
- Common (51-500 proteins):       15.8% of labels
- Very common (>500 proteins):     4.5% of labels
```

**51.6% of labels appear in fewer than 10 proteins!**

**Top 5 Most Common GO Terms**:
1. GO:0005515 (protein binding) - 33,715 proteins (40.9%)
2. GO:0005737 (cytoplasm) - 30,654 proteins (37.2%)
3. GO:0005634 (nucleus) - 29,500 proteins (35.8%)
4. GO:0016020 (membrane) - 25,875 proteins (31.4%)
5. GO:0046872 (metal ion binding) - 23,650 proteins (28.7%)

### 2. Long Sequences

```
Sequence Length Percentiles:
- 25th: 197 AA
- 50th: 376 AA
- 75th: 664 AA
- 90th: 1,114 AA
- 95th: 1,589 AA
- 99th: 3,128 AA
```

**24.8% of sequences exceed 1024 AA** (ESM-2's max context length)

### 3. Multi-Aspect Complexity

Different aspects have different characteristics:
- **C** (2,651 labels): Smallest, most proteins have 1-2 C terms
- **F** (6,616 labels): Medium complexity, well-defined functions
- **P** (16,858 labels): Largest, most complex, hierarchical processes

## Model Selection & Architecture

### Considered Approaches

1. **CNN + LSTM** (from sequence)
   - ❌ Requires training from scratch
   - ❌ Slow to iterate
   - ❌ Needs more data

2. **ProtBERT** (transformer)
   - ✅ Pre-trained on protein sequences
   - ❌ Limited to 512 tokens
   - ❌ Larger memory footprint

3. **ESM-2** (protein language model) ⭐ **SELECTED**
   - ✅ State-of-the-art protein embeddings
   - ✅ Pre-trained on 250M sequences
   - ✅ Supports up to 1024 tokens
   - ✅ Multiple model sizes (8M to 3B)
   - ✅ Fast inference with pre-computed embeddings

### Final Architecture Decision

**Two-Stage Approach**:

```
Stage 1: Embedding Generation (Once)
Protein Sequence → ESM-2 (frozen) → 640-dim embedding → Save to disk

Stage 2: Classification (Fast iteration)
Pre-computed embedding → Dense NN → Multi-task heads → Predictions
```

**Why this approach?**:
- ✅ Generate embeddings once (~1.5-2 hours)
- ✅ Train many classifiers quickly (~30 min each)
- ✅ Easy to experiment with architectures
- ✅ Memory efficient on Kaggle

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Baseline (Quick & Simple)

**Goal**: Get a working submission fast (~2-3 hours total)

```
1. Generate ESM-2 150M embeddings (1.5h)
2. Train simple dense classifier (30min)
3. Make predictions & submit (15min)

Expected F1: 0.45-0.50
```

**Architecture**:
```
Input: 640-dim embedding
  ↓
Dense(640 → 512) + ReLU + Dropout(0.3)
  ↓
Dense(512 → 26,125)
  ↓
Sigmoid → Predictions
```

**Loss**: Focal Loss (handles extreme imbalance)

### Phase 2: Multi-Task Learning (+5-10% F1)

**Goal**: Leverage aspect structure for better performance

```
Input: 640-dim embedding
  ↓
Shared Encoder: Dense(640 → 1024) + ReLU + Dropout(0.3)
  ↓
├─→ C Head: Dense(1024 → 512 → 2,651)   → C predictions
├─→ F Head: Dense(1024 → 512 → 6,616)   → F predictions
└─→ P Head: Dense(1024 → 512 → 16,858)  → P predictions
```

**Loss**: Multi-task focal loss with learnable task weights

**Benefits**:
- Separate learning for each aspect
- Shared representations capture common patterns
- Learnable weights balance C/F/P importance

### Phase 3: Optimizations (+10-15% F1 total)

1. **Larger Model**: ESM-2 650M (+5-8% F1, 2x slower)
2. **Sliding Window**: Handle long sequences better (+2-3% F1, 3x slower)
3. **Threshold Optimization**: Per-label threshold tuning (+3-5% F1, free!)
4. **Ensemble**: Average 3 models (+3-5% F1, 3x time)

---

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Sequence Handling

**Decision**: Balanced truncation for baseline, sliding window for final model

For sequences > 1024 AA:
- **Baseline**: Keep first 512 + last 512 amino acids
  - ✅ Preserves N-terminus (signal peptides)
  - ✅ Preserves C-terminus (localization signals)
  - ✅ Fast, no extra computation

- **Final**: Sliding window with mean pooling
  - ✅ Captures full sequence
  - ✅ +2-3% F1 improvement
  - ❌ 3x slower

### 2. ESM-2 Model Size

**Decision**: Start with 150M, upgrade to 650M for final submission

| Model | Embed Dim | Time (82k proteins) | File Size | Quality |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|-----------|---------|
| 150M  | 640       | 1.5-2 hours         | ~21 GB    | 90%     |
| 650M  | 1280      | 3-4 hours           | ~42 GB    | 100%    |

**Rationale**: 150M gives 90% of performance at 2x speed, perfect for rapid iteration.

### 3. Loss Function

**Decision**: Focal Loss (α=0.25, γ=2.0)

**Why?**:
- Standard BCE fails with extreme imbalance
- Focal loss focuses on hard examples
- Down-weights easy negatives (critical with 26k labels!)
- Expected +5-10% F1 over BCE

### 4. GPU Selection (Kaggle)

**Decision**: Recommend P100 for simplicity, provide T4 x2 option for speed

| GPU | Time (82k) | Complexity | Recommendation |
|-----|------------|------------|----------------|
| P100 | 1.8h | Simple | ✅ Start here |
| T4 x2 | 1.2h | DataParallel | Optimize later |

**Rationale**: P100 has higher memory bandwidth (732 GB/s vs 320 GB/s), which matters for memory-bound transformers. T4 x2 is faster with DataParallel but adds complexity.

## Expected Performance

### Baseline Progression

| Stage | Model | Time | Expected F1 |
|-------|-------|------|-------------|
| 1. Quick baseline | ESM-2 150M + simple NN | 2h | 0.45-0.50 |
| 2. Multi-task | ESM-2 150M + multi-task | 2.5h | 0.50-0.55 |
| 3. Larger model | ESM-2 650M + multi-task | 4h | 0.55-0.60 |
| 4. Optimizations | + threshold + sliding window | 5h | 0.58-0.63 |
| 5. Ensemble | Average 3 models | 15h | 0.60-0.65 |

**Target**: F1 0.60-0.65 is competitive for top 20% in CAFA challenges.

## Lessons Learned & Best Practices

### What Works Well

1. **Pre-compute embeddings** - 10x faster iteration than end-to-end training
2. **Multi-task learning** - Leveraging aspect structure gives +5-10% F1
3. **Focal loss** - Essential for extreme imbalance
4. **Balanced truncation** - Good trade-off for baseline (90% performance, 1x speed)
5. **Threshold optimization** - Easy +3-5% F1 improvement
6. **P100 on Kaggle** - Simpler than T4 x2, nearly as fast

### Common Pitfalls Avoided

1. ❌ Training end-to-end from scratch (too slow for iteration)
2. ❌ Using standard BCE loss (fails with imbalance)
3. ❌ Ignoring long sequences (loses 25% of data)
4. ❌ Using fixed 0.5 threshold (suboptimal)
5. ❌ Not saving embeddings (regenerating wastes hours)
6. ❌ T4 x2 without DataParallel (wastes 1 GPU)
